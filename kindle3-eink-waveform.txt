Somewhat common problem with Kindle 3 is missing grays on eink screen. Usually, reason for this is
missing waveform file to drive eink which results in follwoing dmesg errors:

eink_fb: W log_battery_temperature:def:temp=84F:from battery
eink_fb: W bs_cmd_ld_img_upd_data_which:def:temp=35C:from pmic, outside of ideal range of 15C to 32C
eink_fb: W bs_cmd_ld_img_upd_data_which:def:temp=29C:from battery

Examining kernel /proc and /sys files we can see that display is using internal waveform and that it doesn't have
panel id.

[root@kindle root]# cat /proc/eink_fb/waveform_version 
V110_B059_60_WJ0105_D (M06, S/N 804, 85Hz)

[root@kindle root]# cat /sys/devices/platform/eink_fb.0/panel_id 
????_???_??_???

In this case, it's eeprom on eink flat-flex cable which died. Same thing also happends when you buy replacement
screens and receive one without eeprom on it.

Reading through Amazon's kernel source, I found that eink module tries to load isis.wbf waveform file if it exists.
Since I didn't know which one to use, I randomly picked latest one:

[root@kindle root]# cd /var/local/eink/
[root@kindle eink]# cp V220_004_60_M12 isis.wbf
